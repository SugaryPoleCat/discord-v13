Through my testing, i found that mesageCreate doesnt work. For-- some reason. Cant even read the message contents so i cant check if this works or not. So, what we have to do, apparently, is do the fucking REST registering commands.

WHICH is a problem.

SO we will have to load in the servers, that our bot is connected to, after its launched.
Then, we have to deploy commands to that server. 
BUt we dont want to re-deploy ALL commands = process intensive and API limit shit
SO what we have to do, is: 
on start, check servers its connected to, check the COMMANDS it has deployed, or their version, if they are old, update,
THEN if added to a new server, deploy commands for the server.
Also include the prefix to our commands, so that we can do /!server for example.
Because maybe someone else has already /server, you know.


UPDATE 1:
There are global commands, but they SLOWLY get populated. So during DEV, its good to use GUILD commands.
It possible to addd .subcommand. You can even add CHOICES! with .addCHoice THERES EVEN OPTIONS! So you can type something back after reply! no more collector madness!
